This is Cindy and Kush's CS231N project.

Most of the work are in the project_vgg and project_encode_decode python notebooks. combine_plots and view_images are python notebooks that make figures and run all our models on images, respectively. The python scripts are just helper scripts that do mass directory reconstruction or file conversions.

Data is not included in this repository, just due to size reasons.
